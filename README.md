# Supermarket Location Hotelling Equilibrium

5th November 2021

This repository contains the scripts used to generate a geospatial visualisation of the three major supermarket brands 
in Auckland, New Zealand.

Having read an introduction to Hotelling's model of spatial competition, I started thinking about how to visualise a 
spatial distribution of competitive brands. Auckland is dominated by three supermarket chains, hence I decided to use 
them for this project.

This project utilises data from OpenStreetMap and open source tools including: 
- Openrouteservice,
- The Overpass API, and 
- Leaflet.js (via Folium)
